I have tested my methods by calling them in the main class. I have created 5 methods which are, 
makeConnection() -for connecting with database, 
add() -for adding customers to the database, 
update() -for updating customers in the database, 
delete() -for deleting customers from the database, 
getData() -for getting all the customers from the database

input:
      makeConnection();
      add(1,"Asel Esra", "Ozyilmaz", 706197714, "Isakaev/Bishkek");
      add(2,"Osman Yasir", "Ozyilmaz", 706197714, "Kokjar/Bishkek");
      add(3,"Gunduzalp", "Dogrutekin", 706417519, "Djal/Bishkek");
      update(2,"Osman Yasir", "Ozyilmaz", 551115571, "Kokjar/Bishkek");
      delete(3);
      getData();


If each method is executed without problem then the output is going to tell us what have we done.
output:
      ---------- Making connection with the DB ----------
      Connection Successful!

      ---------- Adding customers to DB ----------
